# Decisions log

Every departure from, or addition to, `docs/foundation.md`. Newest last. Each entry: what, why, and whether it is a parameter (implementer's call) or a shape change (owner is consulted).

## D1 — Two seeds: `map_seed` and `sim_seed`
The foundation says one seed drives map generation and the noise term, but the contingency check runs 20 seeds on the *same* terrain. Map generation takes `map_seed`; the simulation `Rng` takes `sim_seed`. A run is identified by `(map_seed, sim_seed, params)`.
Kind: interface detail, approved by owner.

## D2 — Cultivation targets a surplus margin
As written, cultivation claims cells until yield covers need, so `food/need ≈ 1` and the growth term `r·min(ratio, 1.2) − r` is ≈ 0: villages could never grow on food. Cultivation now claims until yield covers `need × cult_margin` (default 1.2), still bounded by `R_cult`. Release hysteresis (10%) applies to the same target.
Kind: parameter (`cult_margin`), no change to the growth equation.

## D3 — Cross-platform float determinism via `libm`
`exp`, `ln`, `powf` in `core` go through the `libm` crate so native (CLI) and wasm builds produce bit-identical snapshots and the golden hash holds on both.
Kind: implementation.

## D4 — Package names
Packages are `hinterlands-core`, `hinterlands-mapgen`, `hinterlands-web`, `hinterlands-cli` (a crate named `core` collides with Rust's `core`). Commands use the full names, e.g. `cargo run -p hinterlands-cli -- validate --seeds 20`.
Kind: implementation.

## D5 — Small gaps filled
- Diagonal edges cost `√2 ×` the per-km rate.
- `hub` = the cell's route load carries flow from at least two distinct trading pairs.
- Gravity flows `T_ij` are computed over all pairs within `C_max` (route loads, inflow); physical food transfer goes only to settlements in deficit.
- Map generation records the main river mouth cell in `Terrain` for the contingency check.
Kind: interpretation of the spec.

## D6 — Random draws never use `usize`
`rand`'s `gen_range` over `usize` samples differently on 32-bit wasm and 64-bit native, which broke cross-platform determinism in the first browser self-test. All draws use `u32` ranges. Checked by `?selftest=N` in the browser against `hinterlands hash --years N`.
Kind: implementation.

## D7 — Stream-power incision lands early on the map track
On a tilted-plane heightmap, D8 drainage gives parallel streams to the sea and no dominant river, which defeats the river and break-of-bulk behaviours. A simple stream-power incision pass (`fluvial_incision`, between thermal erosion and hydrology) produces dendritic networks with a few main rivers. The foundation lists hydraulic erosion as a later map pass and allows map passes to land early, since the systems never see how terrain was made.
Kind: map generation pass, allowed by the map track rule.

## D8 — Saves are replays
A save file is `(map_seed, sim_seed, params, year)`. Loading regenerates the terrain and replays to the year; determinism makes the state identical, and the file stays tiny and readable.
Kind: implementation.

## D9 — The viewer reads snapshots in-process
The viewer and the core are both Rust in one wasm module, so the snapshot is passed as a value through `SimHandle` rather than as bincode bytes over a JS boundary. The bincode form remains what the CLI writes and what tests hash.
Kind: implementation.

## D10 — Boarding and alighting from the bank
Boats are boarded from a bank cell next to a navigable river (transshipment plus one land step) and left the same way, rather than by first crossing onto the river cell. Without this, every boarding also paid the river-crossing cost and inland settlements could not use rivers.
Kind: interpretation of the cost table.

## D11 — Longer navigable rivers
Navigability now needs 200 km² of drainage and a gradient under 1% (was 300 km² and 0.4%), giving main rivers navigable 40–60 km inland on a 128 km map, as on medieval lowland rivers. Map parameters, not model parameters.
Kind: parameter.
