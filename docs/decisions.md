# Decisions log

Every departure from, or addition to, `docs/foundation.md`. Newest last. Each entry: what, why, and whether it is a parameter (implementer's call) or a shape change (owner is consulted).

## D1 — Two seeds: `map_seed` and `sim_seed`
The foundation says one seed drives map generation and the noise term, but the contingency check runs 20 seeds on the *same* terrain. Map generation takes `map_seed`; the simulation `Rng` takes `sim_seed`. A run is identified by `(map_seed, sim_seed, params)`.
Kind: interface detail, approved by owner.

## D2 — Cultivation targets a surplus margin
As written, cultivation claims cells until yield covers need, so `food/need ≈ 1` and the growth term `r·min(ratio, 1.2) − r` is ≈ 0: villages could never grow on food. Cultivation now claims until yield covers `need × cult_margin` (default 1.2), still bounded by `R_cult`. Release hysteresis (10%) applies to the same target.
Kind: parameter (`cult_margin`), no change to the growth equation.

## D3 — Cross-platform float determinism via `libm`
`exp`, `ln`, `powf` in `core` go through the `libm` crate so native (CLI) and wasm builds produce bit-identical snapshots and the golden hash holds on both.
Kind: implementation.

## D4 — Package names
Packages are `hinterlands-core`, `hinterlands-mapgen`, `hinterlands-web`, `hinterlands-cli` (a crate named `core` collides with Rust's `core`). Commands use the full names, e.g. `cargo run -p hinterlands-cli -- validate --seeds 20`.
Kind: implementation.

## D5 — Small gaps filled
- Diagonal edges cost `√2 ×` the per-km rate.
- `hub` = the cell's route load carries flow from at least two distinct trading pairs.
- Gravity flows `T_ij` are computed over all pairs within `C_max` (route loads, inflow); physical food transfer goes only to settlements in deficit.
- Map generation records the main river mouth cell in `Terrain` for the contingency check.
Kind: interpretation of the spec.
